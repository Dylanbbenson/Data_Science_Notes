# Data_Science_Notes
These are just some notes I wrote while learning Data Science concepts and languages, like Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and subsequent modules. Some of the modules include Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,and FBProphet. I often use the code in these notes when performing other projects, so I'll sometimes add to this repository anything that I thought was helpful. Maybe it'll help you too?
